The terms AnnotationProcessor, KAPT, and KSP are all related to annotation processing in Java and Kotlin,
but they serve different purposes and have evolved over time to address specific needs in the development ecosystem.
Here's a detailed explanation of each, their differences, and how they have changed:

1. AnnotationProcessor


What it is:
->Annotation processors are tools used in Java to process annotations at compile time.

->They are part of the Java Annotation Processing Tool (APT) and are used to generate code, validate code
or perform other tasks based on annotations.


How it works:
->During compilation, the Java compiler (javac) scans the code for annotations
and invokes the corresponding annotation processors.

->Annotation processors can generate new source files, which are then compiled along with the original code.


Use case:

->Commonly used in libraries like Dagger, ButterKnife, and Room to generate boilerplate code.

Limitations:

Works only with Java sources.

Does not natively support Kotlin.




2. KAPT (Kotlin Annotation Processing Tool)
What it is:

->KAPT is a Kotlin plugin that enables the use of Java annotation processors in Kotlin projects.

->It acts as a bridge between Kotlin and Java annotation processors.


How it works:

->KAPT generates Java stubs for Kotlin classes and methods that contain annotations.

->These stubs are then processed by the Java annotation processors.

->After processing, the generated code is compiled along with the Kotlin code.


Use case:

->Allows Kotlin projects to use Java-based annotation processors like Dagger, Room, and Glide.

Limitations:

->Slower than native Kotlin solutions because it generates intermediate Java stubs.

->Does not fully leverage Kotlin's features (e.g., Kotlin-specific types and metadata).



3. KSP (Kotlin Symbol Processing)
What it is:

->KSP is a modern, Kotlin-first annotation processing tool developed by Google.

->It is designed to be faster and more efficient than KAPT, with native support for Kotlin.


How it works:

->KSP directly processes Kotlin code without generating intermediate Java stubs.

->It provides a Kotlin-friendly API to analyze and generate code, leveraging Kotlin's type system and metadata.


Use case:

->Ideal for Kotlin projects that need to process annotations or generate code.

->Libraries like Room and Moshi have started adopting KSP for better performance and Kotlin compatibility.


Advantages over KAPT:

->Faster: No need to generate Java stubs.

->Kotlin-native: Works directly with Kotlin code and types.

->More powerful: Provides better access to Kotlin-specific features (e.g., nullability, extension functions).
